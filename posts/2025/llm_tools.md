ChatGPT memory feature

we can say "Can you please remember this", which shows memory updated, it updates data about you(preferences) in a database , this helps the model to know you better through this memory feature. All its doing is add these memories as tokens in the beggining as a context

You can also do the preferences part in the settings of ChatGPT by answering the question "What traits should ChatGPT have ?"

**Custom GPTS**

Create custom gpts using prompt instructions and later use these custom gpts, just avoids using the same prompting again
